## BESS (Berkeley Extensible Software Switch)

BESS (formerly known as [SoftNIC](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2015/EECS-2015-155.html)) is a modular framework for software switches. BESS itself is *not* a virtual switch; it is neither pre-configured nor hardcoded to provide particular functionality, such as Ethernet bridging or OpenFlow-driven switching. Instead, you (or an external controller) can *configure* your own packet processing datapath by composing small "modules". While the basic concept is similar to [Click](http://read.cs.ucla.edu/click/click), BESS does not sacrifice performance for programmability.

BESS is developed at the University of California, Berkeley and at Nefeli Networks. [Contributors to BESS](https://github.com/NetSys/bess/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) include students, researchers, and developers who care about networking with high performance and high customizability. BESS is open-source under a BSD license.

If you are new to BESS, we recommend you start here:

1. [BESS Overview](https://github.com/NetSys/bess/wiki/BESS-Overview)
2. [Build and Install BESS](https://github.com/NetSys/bess/wiki/Build-and-Install-BESS)
3. [Write a BESS Configuration Script](https://github.com/NetSys/bess/wiki/Writing-a-BESS-Configuration-Script)
4. [Connect BESS to a Network Interface, VM, or Container](https://github.com/NetSys/bess/wiki/Hooking-up-BESS-Ports)

To install BESS on Linux quickly, you can download the binary from [Release](https://github.com/NetSys/bess/releases/latest). Please refer to [GCC x86 Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html) to determine which tarball to use. Suppose `bess-core2-linux.tar.gz` is downloaded:

    sudo apt-get install -y python python-pip python-scapy libgraph-easy-perl
    pip install grpcio
    sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=1024  # For single NUMA node systems
    tar -xf bess-core2-linux.tar.gz
    cd bess/
    make -C core/kmod # Build the kernel module
    bessctl/bessctl
