bool CatchExitSignal();

/*!
 * At several points in bess we need to spin off threads that make
 * blocking system calls, and be able to tell these threads to
 * terminate.
 *
 * The actual code inside these threads varies a lot, but there
 * is a lot of common code required, which we abstract away here:
 *
 *  - pick a safe signal
 *  - establish a signal handler to get EINTR from syscalls
 *  - set proper signal masks for that signal in the thread
 *  - send such a signal from outside the thread
 *  - know when to exit the thread
 *
 * You can use SyscallThreadPfuncs or SyscallThreadAny somewhat like
 * std::thread, but it's a bit more like Python's thread class.
 * Instead of t = Thread(f), you override the Run() function in
 * your derived class.  Here's a realish example:
 *
 *   class SomeThread : public SyscallThreadAny {
 *     ...
 *     void Run() override { ... code goes here ... }
 *   };
 *   class X {
 *     ...
 *     SomeThread thread;
 *     ...
 *   };
 *   X var;
 *   ...
 *   var.thread.Start();
 *
 * and your SomeThread::Run() will be called in the started thread.
 *
 * In Run(), check IsExitRequested() any time your system call(s)
 * return(s) with an EINTR error, as these are requests for your
 * thread to terminate.  You can check it any other time as well.
 * (We check it once before even calling Run(), so your Run() may
 * not get called at all, in an extreme race case.)
 *
 * Optionally (for performance / avoiding more signals), you may
 * call BeginExiting() once you are irrevocably on the way to
 * returning.  This tells the knock thread (see below) that
 * its job is done, avoiding further signals.
 *
 * Once your Run() returns (the thread has exited), var.thread.Done()
 * will return True.
 *
 * You may WaitFor() the thread, or call Terminate(), at any time:
 * these are no-ops if the thread was never Start()ed.  By default,
 * Terminate() waits for termination.  You can call it with
 * SyscallThread::WaitType::kRequestOnly to ask it to send the
 * termination signal without waiting.
 *
 * Once Start()ed, the thread is not re-Start()able until
 * Terminate()d and/or WaitFor()ed, after which you may --
 * CAREFULLY (e.g., under locks if this could race) -- invoke
 * Reset() to put it back to "never started" state.
 *
 * Because many system calls are not available in a reliable-signal
 * flavor (cf. pselect/ppoll), requesting an exit normally starts a
 * "knock thread" that keeps kicking your Run() code to get it to
 * return.  Each kick will interrupt a system call, if you are in
 * one, but if you aren't, your next syscall will block until the
 * next kick.
 *
 * This part is optional: if (by using SyscallThreadPfuncs) you
 * declare that you are using the reliable signal system calls, and
 * never block in any other syscall, you can skip the knock thread.
 * In this case you should call Sigmask() to obtain the correct
 * mask to use in pselect/ppoll, and then you *must* check
 * IsExitRequested() immediately after the pselect/ppoll returns.
 *
 * Otherwise, there is a race between any IsExitRequested() test and
 * the entry to a system call.  This is why we have the knock thread:
 * it will repeatedly send the interrupt signal.  Eventually we
 * must win the race and you will get -1/EINTR and IsExitRequested()
 * will be true.
 *
 * This means that when using SyscallThreadAny, if you need to
 * make system calls in Run() that *must not* be interrupted, you
 * should call PushDefer() first.  Knock-thread signals will be
 * deferred until all pushed defers are popped.
 *
 * Note that BeginExiting() pushes a defer.
 *
 * MAYBE-to-do(torek): allow detaching (move the state variables
 * into a sub-object that is given to the thread, so that we can
 * use thread_.detach() and knock_thread_.detach()).  If we do this
 * we need new/dispose, std::unique_ptr<...>, and/or refcounts.
